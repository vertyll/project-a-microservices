-- Identity: users, roles and the permissions a role grants.
--
-- Keycloak owns credentials and sessions. What is here is the profile and the authorization
-- model, joined to Keycloak by `keycloak_id`; there is no password column and no refresh token,
-- because neither is this service's to hold.
--
-- A permission is granted to a role, never to a person. Attaching permissions directly to users
-- is not RBAC: granting access becomes a list of tick boxes per person, "what can a manager do"
-- has no answer, and nobody can say which people hold a given right. `User.permissions` is
-- derived from roles at read time and never stored — see docs/architecture.md.

-- tomorrow is covered the day it registers instead of when somebody remembers to tick
-- it. scope says where the role can be held: a GLOBAL role is held platform-wide and
-- lands in the Keycloak token; a PROJECT role is held inside one project and is
-- assigned by project-service.
